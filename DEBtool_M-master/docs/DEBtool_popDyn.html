      <h1>DEBtool Toolbox: popDyn</h1>

      A collection of functions that computes population trajectories of individuals.
      The step from individuals to populations can be made in several ways, each with their own weak and strong poperties,
      as discussed at the <a href="https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/popDyn/popDyn.html" target="_blank">popDyn page</a>.
      This page assumes that the popDyn page is known; it partly serves as manual an just gives some supplementary information.

      <h2><a name="constant">Constant environments, no interaction</a></h2>
      If a homogenous environment remains constant in terms of food availability and temperature, the population will eventually grow exponentially
      at a rate that follows from the <a href="" title="1=int_{a_p}^{a_m} S(a) R(a) exp(-r_N a) da, with a=age, a_p=age at puberty, a_m=age at death, 
       S=survivor prob, R=reprod rate, r_N = spec pop growth rate">chacteristic equation</a>.
      This equation determines this rate implicitly only, and the specific population growth rate needs to be obtained numerically from this equation.

      <p>
      Function <a href="https://debtool.debtheory.org/popDyn/html/sgr_mod.html" target="_blank"><b>sgr_mod</b></a>,
      standing for "specific (population) growth rate", solves the characteristic equation for all the DEB models.
      This growth rate depends on temperature and food availability.
      Function <a href="https://debtool.debtheory.org/popDyn/html/f_ris0_mod.html" target="_blank"><b>f_ris0_mod</b></a>
      finds the scaled functional response (f) for which the specific population growth rate is zero (ris0), again for all DEB models.
      Function <a href="https://debtool.debtheory.org/popDyn/html/ssd_mod.html" target="_blank"><b>ssd_mod</b></a> computes a number of population characteristics:
      The mean length, squared length, cubed length and wet weight of the individuals in the population, if at pseudo steady state (meaning that the stable age distribution is reached).
      On top of that, a large number of other population characteristics is computed, such as yield coefficients, as described for the standard DEB model
      <a href="https://debtool.debtheory.org/popDyn/html/ssd_std.html" target="_blank"><b>ssd_std</b></a>.

      <h2><a name="dynamic">Dynamic environments, with interaction via competition</a></h2>
      The next level of DEBtool/popDyn functions considers a generalized well-stirred reaktor environment with a pre-described, possibly varying, food input,
      and hazard rates for (inert) food particles and the various stages of individuals. Chemostats and fed-batch cultures are special cases of generalized reaktors.
      
      <h3><a name="CMP">Cohort Projection Models (CPMs)</a></h3>

      <h3><a name="EBT">Escalator Boxcar Trains (EBT)</a></h3>
      The function <a href="https://debtool.debtheory.org/popDyn/html/EBT.html" target="_blank"><b>EBT</b></a> writes the txt-files eaLE.txt, spline_JX.txt, spline_TC.txt and
      set_pars.txt as input files for EBT (see below).
      EBT writes an outout file, which in readinto Matlab for be presently graphically.

      <p>
      The file eaLE.txt is used to get the embryo-states by interpolation and can best be changed via IBM, since the numbers depend on some parameters.
      The file spline_JX.txt (units: d,mol/d) sets the knots of the spline for the food-input to the reactor as function of time.
      The temperature correction factor is given as function of time by spline_TC.txt (units: d,-). If just the reference-temperature is chosen for 1e4 days,
      this file has the contents: line 1: 0 1; line 2: 1e4 1. So 4 numbers only.
      One can also mimic seasonally changing trajectories, both for food and for temperature (correction factors).
      Notice the physiological rate parameters depend on temperature, but the background hazards and food supply to the reactor do not.

      <p>
      The population starts from a single female embryo, gender assignment is randomly for all other individuals with equal probability.
      Males might differ from females by specific assimilation and maturity at puberty.
      Males might be absent, depending on the reproduction-setting.


      <h3><a name="IBM">Individual-Based Models (IBMs)</a></h3>
      The function <a href="https://debtool.debtheory.org/popDyn/html/IBM.html" target="_blank"><b>IBM</b></a> writes the txt-files eaLE.txt, spline_JX.txt, spline_TC.txt and
      set_pars.txt as input files for NetLogo (see below).
      NetLogo then runs automatically or can be started independently by hitting button "go" in the gui, while it  writes an output file txNL23W.txt.
      This output file is a table with time, food density, sum over all individuals of lengths to the power 0,1,2,3 and weight, and is either shown in the NetLogo gui,
      or is imported and shown graphically in Matlab.

      <p>
	If IBM is run in the NetLogo gui, pressing button "setup" forces Netlogo to import set_pars.txt to set the parameters; they can be modified in the gui (hit button "Settings").
      In this mode, the gui updates the graphs while running, but this takes quite a bit of extra computation time.
      The file eaLE.txt is used to get the embryo-states by interpolation and can best be changed via IBM, since the numbers depend on some parameters.
      The file spline_JX.txt (units: d,mol/d) sets the knots of the spline for the food-input to the reactor as function of time.
      The temperature correction factor is given as function of time by spline_TC.txt (units: d,-). If just the reference-temperature is chosen for 1e4 days,
      this file has the contents: line 1: 0 1; line 2: 1e4 1. So 4 numbers only.
      One can also mimic seasonally changing trajectories, both for food and for temperature (correction factors).
      These spline-files can be edited.
      Notice the physiological rate parameters depend on temperature, but the background hazards and food supply to the reactor do not.

      <p>
      The various DEB models are described in the NetLogo gui (dropdown "Tabs", then "Info"), while the code can be seen via dropdown "Tabs", then "Code".
      The population starts from a single female embryo, gender assignment is randomly for all other individuals with equal probability.
      Males might differ from females by specific assimilation and maturity at puberty.
      Males might be absent, depending on the reproduction-setting.

      <p>
      Since NetLogo follows individuals, the required computation time (which can be considerable) directly relates to the total integration time (t_max), the
       number of integration steps per unit of time (tickRate) and the number of individuals in the population.
      The latter is mainly controlled by the food input into the reactor, i.e. spline_JX.
      The idea is that the tickRate is chosen as small as possible, without affecting the trajectories too much.
      The food-input to the reactor is best chosen such that the numbers range somewhere between 100 and 1000, wile t_max such be several times the maximum lifespan of individuals.
